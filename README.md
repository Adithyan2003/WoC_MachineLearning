ABSTRACT:
        In this project we were asked to build our own Machine Learning Library by devloping few algorithms from scratch. The Algorithms are:
        1) Linear Regression
        2) Polynomial Regression
        3) Logistic Regression
        4) K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) algorithm
        5) K-Means Clustering
        6) Neural Networks

BRIEF IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
       I have successfully implemented all the above mentioned algorithms, and trained the model to a decent accuracy.
Linear Regression:
                In Linear Regression the core idea is to obtain a straight that best fits the dataset where the error is as small as possible. I trained my model with the given 'Linear_test.csv' and 'Linear_train.csv' dataset and obtained a test accuracy of 98.50767%
Polynomial Regression:
                Polynomial regression is similar to Linear Regression and the only difference is that there are a lot features in it. I trained my model with the given "Polynomial_test.csv' and 'Polynomial_train.csv' dataset and obtained a test accuracy of 89.70174%
Logistic regression:
               Logistic regression is an algorith that is mainly used for 'Classification' type of dataset. The given dataset was E-MNIST which is a set of handwritten characters derived from NIST database. I trained my model from the given 'emnist-letters-test.csv' and 'emnist-letters-train.csv' and obtained a test accuracy of 97.24828%
KNN:
               KNN is an algorith where the model analyses the neighboring datas of the given dataset and matches similar datas. I trained my model with the given 'emnist-letters-test.csv' and 'emnist-letters-train.csv' and obtained a test accuracy of 83.08%             
K-means:
               K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm where the model creates K number of clusters and matches the datas according to the pattern in the datas. I trained the model and as it was an unsupervised learning model accuracy could not be predicted.
Neural Network:
              Neural Networks is a type of algorithm which mimics the working of human brain. I trained the model with all the datas provided, i.e 'Linear_train.csv', 'Linear_test.csv', 'Polynomial_test.csv', 'Polynomial_train.csv', 'emnist-letters-test.csv' and 'emnist-letters-train.csv' For Linear Regression model, I obtained a RMSE error of 0.99367. For Polynomial Regression, model I obtained a RMSE error of 0.972677. For EMNIST model I obtained a test accuracy of 71.04697%
